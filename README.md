# CardioCare
 
CardioCare is a device made for those with heart problems. It checks the users heartrate and depending on if the BPM is too high or too low it will contact the emergency services from the CardioCare mobile app.

This project was made just for fun and as a challenge to improve my coding skills, It is not seriously designed for medical purposes. I had alot of fun making it but don't count on it to save your life!
